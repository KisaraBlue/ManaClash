First concetp ideas:


Two players with 6 energy points and 30 different cards at the beginning.
Two types of cards: material and immaterial
Materials are creatures, objects, equipments, fields
Immaterials are effects on cards, the field, the players, the energy resources 
The winning condition is having an energy resource at the end of a turn while your opponent have none.
Each turn you can play as many cards as you want from your hand, you can draw one card and you can attack once with each creature.


Each players starts with 30 energy points and 30 cards.
Cards are monsters, equipment or effects.
Invoking a monster takes one energy points, but you only lose it when the monster dies.
At each turn you can play your cards in hands, make one/all your living monsters do one thing, and take one card in your deck.
Typical capacities of monsters:
- attack other monsters (active)
- defend itself (passive)
- attack the player (active)
Possible special capacities :
- restore one energy point by sacrifying itself
- etc...
Equipment cards :
- shield (for monsters or player)
- restoring potions (for both too)
- etc
Effects cards :
- boost one type of monster
- allows youbto take several cards
- rescucitate a monster
- etc
